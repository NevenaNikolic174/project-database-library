# project-database-library

This project was undertaken during the second year of studies with the primary objective of designing and implementing a database for a specific application. The project aimed to create an optimal and well-structured database that adheres to norms, conventions, and standards for database development and maintenance.

For this project, the chosen application was Library. The database was designed to support all the functionalities of this application and facilitate efficient data management.

In accordance with the provided requirements, the database consists of [number of tables] tables that are interconnected to establish an integrated data structure. Each table has defined columns with appropriate data types, and column names are in English.

In the process of designing the database, special attention was given to creating views that facilitate commonly used queries or display data in a specific manner. A total of [number of views] views were developed to provide relevant information to the application's users.

Furthermore, to automate certain processes, triggers have been implemented. These triggers enable automatic data updates upon performing specific actions within the application, such as adding an invoice item or recording creation and update times.

Additionally, stored procedures have been implemented for all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database. These procedures not only streamline data manipulation but also provide additional validation to ensure consistency and accuracy of entered information.

To track activity and queries performed on the database, a mechanism for recording all executed queries has been established. This log includes information such as execution date, user responsible for the query, and relevant query data.

Database security has also been taken into consideration. A dedicated user with restricted access to only defined views, procedures, and functions has been created to ensure that sensitive data is not unnecessarily exposed to risks.

The project documentation provides a detailed description of each table, their relationships, columns and data types, as well as information on related views, functions, triggers, and procedures. A diagram depicting all tables with their relationships is also included to visually illustrate the database structure.

The project was carried out following best practices for designing and implementing databases, and the documentation offers all necessary information for understanding and maintaining the database in the future.
